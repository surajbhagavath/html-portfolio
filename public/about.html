<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Suraj Bhagavath, a passionate engineering student with a strong interest in full stack web development, cybersecurity, and creative editing. Currently in my 3rd year, I’m on a mission to level up my skills through hands-on learning, building real-world projects, and constantly challenging myself to improve..</p>

<p>I’m currently focused on mastering Angela Yu’s Full Stack Web Development course, followed by diving into ethical hacking (Zaid’s Cybersecurity course) and video editing (Tarun Speaks Editing Masterclass). Outside of tech, I’m a committed sports player—I play cricket daily, which fuels my discipline and teamwork.</p>

<p>I believe in silent growth, strong comebacks, and letting my work speak for itself. My goal is to win a hackathon, contribute meaningfully to projects, and become someone who's respected for both skill and character.</p>
